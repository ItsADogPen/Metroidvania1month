		"6" : "These familiar cries constantly saying my name.",
		"7" : "In front only had a large path, which I had no idea where it would lead me.",

		"2" : "Uh… I didn't understand a lick of what you were saying. You were stalking me all the way through?",
		"3" : "I apologise for mine own previous speech, it has been ages since I have seen someone here. I have many names, like Ankou, Mot, Grim Reaper, even just Grim. Feel free to call mine own as thee wish.",
		"4" : "Could you please explain to me what I'm doing and how I arrived here, Statue of Bone Daddy?",
		"5" : "Ahhh... P-please… j-just call mine own Grim Reaper.",
		"6" : "Sure... but that doesn't explain anything!",
		"7" : "Th..you here because you are lost. Your sins don't allow you to go to heaven and they are too big for you to be accepted in hell!",
		"8" : "What can I do, to escape this place and go back home though? I'm sure there is a way.",
		"9" : "There is none. You died, and now you'll remain here forever. You are stuck for all eternity in this realm.",
		"10": "I-imposible... t-there must be a way... anything...",
		"11": "It is possible... but at the same time, impossible. None of the ones that tried have succeeded and came back to tell it. According to the old runes, written before the war between realms, souls could be revived in their original world after defeating the guardians of their sins in hell.",
		"12": "You might have to defeat all of the 9 guardians, each worse and stronger than the last. It's reckless though as each guardian was specially created to restrain sinners from leaving.",
		"13": "It's the only way I can return and I have no choice. Maybe I could die, but I won't waste my time forever. I left something important and I need to go back.",
		"14": "Be aware that what you might find down may not please you. Your memories were sealed for a reason. Maybe you couldn't bear with them and you'drather forget. Madness could swallow you.",
		"15": "It's important to me, I don't care if that happens. At least I would be able to go home.",
		"16": "Cross the portal to the first circle, the Forest of Lies and Fraud. There, you will find the first guardian, Rosemary. She is... a little nasty. And pretty dangerous, so be careful with her. Don't be fooled by the things you see and hear; they'll do anything to hold you back."

		"3" : "You are not fun and you called me a slut so I will have to eliminate you. Let me show you the fury of a guardian. Maybe after we can have lots of fun!",

		"5" : "Wait! What did you... dammit, she is gone! I wonder what she meant to say. Whatever, maybe there is something more I have to see. Then I will go back and tell him what happened."

		"4" : "My powers are slowly coming back but they are not enough for such task.",
		"5" : "Are you telling me I have to wait centuries here?!",
		"6" : "I'm afraid to say that it the case. Time in this realm flows slower than in the human world and it's not so simple as a snap of your fingers.",
		"7" : "You can keep training your skills for the next battle if you wish.",
		"8" : "It's the only thing I can do right now. Also I have been wondering, but why am I in a swimsuit?",
		"9" : "You arrived as you died. Perhaps your life ended on the beach, or you could have drawn on the sea. I can do nothing to change it.",

		"3" : "This book might be related to my past, but seems incomplete. I may need time to properly think about what it means.",
		"4" : "Could it be I was some kind of killer? Anyway I should get moving."
